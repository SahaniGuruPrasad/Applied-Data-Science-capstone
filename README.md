## SpaceX Rocket Launch Outcome Prediction
### Objective of project
SpaceX is an aerospace company that has changed the dynamics of 
space industry by introducing a reusable rocket by advertising Falcon 
9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars 
while other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much 
of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. As a Data 
Scientist of rivaling company the goal is to create a Machine Learning 
pipeline which can predict the landing outcome of first stage of 
falcon 9 by which the company can identify the right price to bid 
against SpaceX at rocket launch. <br>
<h3>GoalðŸŽ¯</h3>
The Goal of this project is to build a machine learning model which can acurrately predict the Rocket Launch Outcome based on Launch site<br>
<h3>Phases of the Project</h3>
The Project have undergone with several phases:
<h4>1. Data Collection</h4>
The Data Collection involves collecting the data from SpaceX REST APIs and Web scraping of Wikipedia website. <br><br>
<ul>
  <li><b>SpaceX Rest API</b>
    <p>The contents from Rest API is extracted by making a GET resquest using requests library and decoding the content in json format to futher converting it into a pandas dataframe.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Web Scraping</b>
    <p>In web scraping the data has been collected from Wikipedia where the launch records data is extracted using beautifulsoup as HTML tables and then converted into a pandas dataframe.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>2. Data Wrangling</h4>
<h4>3. Data Analysis</h4>
<h4>4. Data Visualization</h4>
<h4>5. Model Development using Machine Learning</h4>
